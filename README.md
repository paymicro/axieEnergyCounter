## GOOD TO KNOW
Use windowed mode in game.

* USE `+` to add energy
* USE `-` to remove energy
* USE `ENTER` to add 2 energy at the end of the round
* USE `ESC` to reset the counter at the end of the game

By default all keys is hooked globaly and intercept the specified keys in any application. But this application had to work with administrator rights to work properly with the game window.
